390  CHAPTER 8 / VIRTUAL MEMORY
8.7  RECOMMENDED READING AND WEB SITES
     As might be expected, virtual memory receives good coverage in most books on
     operating systems. [MILE92] provides a good summary of various research areas.
     [CARR84] provides an excellent in-depth examination of performance issues. The
     classic paper [DENN70] is still well worth a read. [DOWD93] provides an instruc-
     tive performance analysis of various page replacement algorithms. [JACO98a] is a
     good survey of issues in virtual memory design; it includes a discussion of inverted
     page tables. [JACO98b] looks at virtual memory hardware organizations in various
     microprocessors.
        It is a sobering experience to read [IBM86], which gives a detailed account of
     the tools and options available to a site manager in optimizing the virtual memory
     policies of MVS. The document illustrates the complexity of the problem.
        [VAHA96] is one of the best treatments of the memory management schemes
     used in the various flavors of UNIX. [GORM04] is a thorough treatment of Linux
     memory management.

          Review Questions
          8.1    What is the difference between simple paging and virtual memory paging?
          8.2    Explain thrashing.
          8.3    Why is the principle of locality crucial to the use of virtual memory?
          8.4    What elements are typically found in a page table entry? Briefly define each element.
          8.5    What is the purpose of a translation lookaside buffer?
          8.6    Briefly define the alternative page fetch policies.

          Problems
          8.1    Suppose the page table for the process currently executing on the processor looks like
                 the following. All numbers are decimal, everything is numbered starting from zero,
                 and all addresses are memory byte addresses. The page size is 1,024 bytes.
