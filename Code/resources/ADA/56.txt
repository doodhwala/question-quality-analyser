Using Limits for Comparing Orders of Growth
Though the formal definitions of O,        , and       are indispensable for proving their
    abstract properties, they are rarely used for comparing the orders of growth of
    two specific functions. A much more convenient method for doing so is based on
    computing the limit of the ratio of two functions in question. Three principal cases
    may arise:
                               0     implies that t (n) has a smaller order of growth than g(n),
                          
             t (n)
        lim            =       c     implies that t (n) has the same order of growth as g(n),
    n        g(n)         
                                     implies that t (n) has a larger order of growth than g(n).3
    Note that the first two cases mean that t (n)  O(g(n)), the last two mean that
    t (n)    (g(n)), and the second case means that t (n)                                     (g(n)).
        The limit-based approach is often more convenient than the one based on
    the definitions because it can take advantage of the powerful calculus techniques
    developed for computing limits, such as L'Ho^ pital's rule
                                                 lim     t (n) = lim        t (n)
                                                 n g(n)          n g (n)
    and Stirling's formula
                                                        n  n
                                     n!      2 n        e        for large values of n.
        Here are three examples of using the limit-based approach to comparing
    orders of growth of two functions.
    EXAMPLE 1                Compare      the    orders    of    growth  of       1  n(n   -  1)  and  n2.  (This  is  one  of
                                                                                  2
    the examples we used at the beginning of this section to illustrate the definitions.)
                                  1  n(n  -  1)      1           n2 - n        1                    1) =  1
                          lim     2              =      lim              =              lim (1 -             .
                       n             n2              2  n        n2            2     n              n     2
    Since the limit is equal to a positive constant, the functions have the same order
    of  growth    or,     symbolically,      1   n(n  -    1)    (n2).
                                             2
    EXAMPLE 2                Compare the orders of growth of log2 n and                                n. (Unlike Exam-
    ple 1, the answer here is not immediately obvious.)
                  log2 n =                   log2 n              log2 e              1                       1
             lim                     lim                = lim                        n  =  2  log2  e  lim         = 0.
        n                 n       n              n         n             1                             n        n
                                                                     2      n
    Since the limit is       equal   to zero, log2 n has a smaller order                   of growth      than     n. (Since
    limn          log2 n  =  0, we        can use the so-called little-oh                  notation:      log2  n   o(      n).
                    n
    Unlike the big-Oh, the little-oh notation is rarely used in analysis of algorithms.)
3.  The fourth case, in which such a limit does not exist, rarely happens in the actual practice of analyzing
    algorithms. Still, this possibility makes the limit-based approach to comparing orders of growth less
    general than the one based on the definitions of O,          , and         .
    EXAMPLE 3  Compare the orders of growth of n! and 2n. (We discussed this
    informally in Section 2.1.) Taking advantage of Stirling's formula, we get
                            2 n      n  n                 nn                         n
         lim  n! = lim               e     =  lim    2 n        =  lim      2 n  n      = .
        n 2n   n                 2n           n           2nen     n             2e
    Thus, though 2n grows very fast, n!grows still faster. We can write symbolically that
    n!       (2n); note, however, that while the big-Omega notation does not preclude
    the possibility that n! and 2n have the same order of growth, the limit computed
    here certainly does.
