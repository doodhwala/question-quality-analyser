In this section, we consider the application of the brute-force approach to the
         problem of sorting: given a list of n orderable items (e.g., numbers, characters
         from some alphabet, character strings), rearrange them in nondecreasing order.
         As we mentioned in Section 1.3, dozens of algorithms have been developed for
         solving this very important problem. You might have learned several of them in
         the past. If you have, try to forget them for the time being and look at the problem
         afresh.
         Now, after your mind is unburdened of previous knowledge of sorting algo-
         rithms, ask yourself a question: "What would be the most straightforward method
         for solving the sorting problem?" Reasonable people may disagree on the answer
         to this question. The two algorithms discussed here--selection sort and bubble
         sort--seem to be the two prime candidates.
