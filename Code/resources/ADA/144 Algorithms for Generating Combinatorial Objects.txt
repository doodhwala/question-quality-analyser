In this section, we keep our promise to discuss algorithms for generating combi-
          natorial objects. The most important types of combinatorial objects are permuta-
          tions, combinations, and subsets of a given set. They typically arise in problems
          that require a consideration of different choices. We already encountered them in
          Chapter 3 when we discussed exhaustive search. Combinatorial objects are stud-
          ied in a branch of discrete mathematics called combinatorics. Mathematicians, of
          course, are primarily interested in different counting formulas; we should be grate-
          ful for such formulas because they tell us how many items need to be generated. In
          particular, they warn us that the number of combinatorial objects typically grows
          exponentially or even faster as a function of the problem size. But our primary
          interest here lies in algorithms for generating combinatorial objects, not just in
          counting them.
