Variable-Size-Decrease Algorithms
In the third principal variety of decrease-and-conquer, the size reduction pattern
     varies from one iteration of the algorithm to another. Euclid's algorithm for
     computing the greatest common divisor (Section 1.1) provides a good example
     of this kind of algorithm. In this section, we encounter a few more examples of
     this variety.
