Since the vast majority of algorithms of interest operate on data, particular ways of
     organizing data play a critical role in the design and analysis of algorithms. A data
     structure can be defined as a particular scheme of organizing related data items.
     The nature of the data items is dictated by the problem at hand; they can range
     from elementary data types (e.g., integers or characters) to data structures (e.g., a
     one-dimensional array of one-dimensional arrays is often used for implementing
     matrices). There are a few data structures that have proved to be particularly
     important for computer algorithms. Since you are undoubtedly familiar with most
     if not all of them, just a quick review is provided here.
