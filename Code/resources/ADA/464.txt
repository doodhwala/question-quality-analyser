Newton's Method
Newton's method, also called the Newton-Raphson method, is one of the most im-
     portant general algorithms for solving equations. When applied to equation (12.4)
     in one unknown, it can be illustrated by Figure 12.22: the next element xn+1 of the
     method's approximation sequence is obtained as the x-intercept of the tangent
     line to the graph of function f (x) at xn.
     The analytical formula for the elements of the approximation sequence turns
     out to be
                            xn+1  =  xn  -   f  (xn)     for n = 0, 1, . . . .     (12.11)

In most cases, Newton's algorithm guarantees convergence of sequence (12.11) if
an initial approximation x0 is chosen "close enough" to the root. (Precisely defined
prescriptions for choosing x0 can be found in numerical analysis textbooks.) It may
converge for initial approximations far from the root as well, but this is not always
true.
EXAMPLE 3     Computing      a for a  0 can be done by finding a nonnegative root
of equation x2 - a = 0. If we use formula (12.11) for this case of f (x) = x2 - a and
f (x) = 2x, we obtain
       xn+1 = xn -     f (xn)  = xn  -   xn2 - a  =   xn2 + a  =  1      +  a
                                                                  2 (xn         ),

     which is exactly the formula we used in Section 11.4 for computing approximate
     values of square roots.
     EXAMPLE 4     Let us apply Newton's method to equation (12.9), which we previ-
     ously solved with the bisection method and the method of false position. Formula
     (12.11) for this case becomes
                                    xn+1  =  xn  -  xn3 - xn -  1  .
                                                     3xn2 - 1
     As an initial element of the approximation sequence, we take, say, x0 = 2. Fig-
     ure 12.23 contains the results of the first five iterations of Newton's method.
     You cannot fail to notice how much faster Newton's approximation sequence
     converges to the root than the approximation sequences of both the bisection
     method and the method of false position. This very fast convergence is typical of
     Newton's method if an initial approximation is close to the equation's root. Note,
     however, that on each iteration of this method we need to evaluate new values of
     the function and its derivative, whereas the previous two methods require only one
     new value of the function itself. Also, Newton's method does not bracket a root as
     these two methods do. Moreover, for an arbitrary function and arbitrarily chosen
     initial approximation, its approximation sequence may diverge. And, because
     formula (12.11) has the function's derivative in the denominator, the method may
     break down if it is equal to zero. In fact, Newton's method is most effective when
     f (x) is bounded away from zero near root x. In particular, if
                                          |f (x)|  m1 > 0
     on the interval between xn and x, we can estimate the distance between xn and
     x by using the Mean Value Theorem of calculus as follows:
                                 f (xn) - f (x) = f (c)(xn - x),
     where c is some point between xn and x. Since f (x) = 0 and |f (c)|  m1, we
     obtain

Formula (12.12) can be used as a criterion for stopping Newton's algorithm when
its right-hand side becomes smaller than a preselected accuracy level . Other
possible stopping criteria are
                                |xn - xn-1| < 
and
                                     |f (xn)| < ,
where  is a small positive number. Since the last two criteria do not necessarily
imply closeness of xn to root x, they should be considered inferior to the one
based on (12.12).
     The shortcomings of Newton's method should not overshadow its principal
strengths: fast convergence for an appropriately chosen initial approximation and
applicability to much more general types of equations and systems of equations.
