We saw in the previous section two applications of the brute-force approach to the
          sorting porblem. Here we discuss two applications of this strategy to the problem
          of searching. The first deals with the canonical problem of searching for an item
          of a given value in a given list. The second is different in that it deals with the
          string-matching problem.
