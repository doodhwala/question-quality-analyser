Counting Paths in a Graph
As our next example, we consider the problem of counting paths between two
     vertices in a graph. It is not difficult to prove by mathematical induction that the
     number of different paths of length k > 0 from the ith vertex to the j th vertex
     of a graph (undirected or directed) equals the (i, j )th element of Ak where A is
     the adjacency matrix of the graph. Therefore, the problem of counting a graph's
     paths can be solved with an algorithm for computing an appropriate power of its
     adjacency matrix. Note that the exponentiation algorithms we discussed before
     for computing powers of numbers are applicable to matrices as well.
     As a specific example, consider the graph of Figure 6.16. Its adjacency matrix
     A and its square A2 indicate the numbers of paths of length 1 and 2, respectively,
     between the corresponding vertices of the graph. In particular, there are three
     a            b                a  b            c  d                  a  b      c  d
                                a  0  1            1  1               a  3  0      1  1

paths of length 2 that start and end at vertex a (a - b - a, a - c - a, and a - d - a);
