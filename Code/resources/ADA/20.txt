String Processing
In recent decades, the rapid proliferation of applications dealing with nonnumer-
    ical data has intensified the interest of researchers and computing practitioners in
    string-handling algorithms. A string is a sequence of characters from an alphabet.
    Strings of particular interest are text strings, which comprise letters, numbers, and
    special characters; bit strings, which comprise zeros and ones; and gene sequences,
    which can be modeled by strings of characters from the four-character alphabet {A,
    C, G, T}. It should be pointed out, however, that string-processing algorithms have
    been important for computer science for a long time in conjunction with computer
    languages and compiling issues.
One particular problem--that of searching for a given word in a text--has
attracted special attention from researchers. They call it string matching. Several
algorithms that exploit the special nature of this type of searching have been
invented. We introduce one very simple algorithm in Chapter 3 and discuss two
algorithms based on a remarkable idea by R. Boyer and J. Moore in Chapter 7.
