Geometric algorithms deal with geometric objects such as points, lines, and poly-
    gons. The ancient Greeks were very much interested in developing procedures
    (they did not call them algorithms, of course) for solving a variety of geometric
    problems, including problems of constructing simple geometric shapes--triangles,
    circles, and so on--with an unmarked ruler and a compass. Then, for about 2000
    years, intense interest in geometric algorithms disappeared, to be resurrected in
    the age of computers--no more rulers and compasses, just bits, bytes, and good old
    human ingenuity. Of course, today people are interested in geometric algorithms
    with quite different applications in mind, such as computer graphics, robotics, and
    tomography.
    We will discuss algorithms for only two classic problems of computational
    geometry: the closest-pair problem and the convex-hull problem. The closest-pair
    problem is self-explanatory: given n points in the plane, find the closest pair among
    them. The convex-hull problem asks to find the smallest convex polygon that
    would include all the points of a given set. If you are interested in other geometric
    algorithms, you will find a wealth of material in such specialized monographs as
    [deB10], [ORo98], and [Pre85].
