As our next example, let us consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian circuit
     in the graph in Figure 12.3a.
        Without loss of generality, we can assume that if a Hamiltonian circuit exists,
     it starts at vertex a. Accordingly, we make vertex a the root of the state-space

tree (Figure 12.3b). The first component of our future solution, if it exists, is a
first intermediate vertex of a Hamiltonian circuit to be constructed. Using the
alphabet order to break the three-way tie among the vertices adjacent to a, we
select vertex b. From b, the algorithm proceeds to c, then to d, then to e, and
finally to f, which proves to be a dead end. So the algorithm backtracks from f
to e, then to d, and then to c, which provides the first alternative for the algorithm
to pursue. Going from c to e eventually proves useless, and the algorithm has to
backtrack from e to c and then to b. From there, it goes to the vertices f , e, c, and
d, from which it can legitimately return to a, yielding the Hamiltonian circuit a, b,
f , e, c, d, a. If we wanted to find another Hamiltonian circuit, we could continue
this process by backtracking from the leaf of the solution found.
