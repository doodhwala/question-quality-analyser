Informally, O(g(n)) is the set of all functions with a lower or same order of growth
         as g(n) (to within a constant multiple, as n goes to infinity). Thus, to give a few
         examples, the following assertions are all true:
                      n  O(n2),       100n + 5  O(n2),         1 n(n - 1)  O(n2).
                                                               2
Indeed, the first two functions are linear and hence have a lower order of growth
than g(n) = n2, while the last one is quadratic and hence has the same order of
growth as n2. On the other hand,
n3  O(n2),                0.00001n3  O(n2),     n4 + n + 1  O(n2).
Indeed, the functions n3 and 0.00001n3 are both cubic and hence have a higher
order of growth than n2, and so has the fourth-degree polynomial n4 + n + 1.
The second notation,         (g(n)), stands for the set of all functions with a higher
or same order of growth as g(n) (to within a constant multiple, as n goes to infinity).
For example,
n3            (n2),       1n(n - 1)     (n2),   but 100n + 5     (n2).
                          2
Finally,      (g(n)) is the set of all functions that have the same order of growth
as g(n) (to within a constant multiple, as n goes to infinity). Thus, every quadratic
function an2 + bn + c with a > 0 is in  (n2), but so are, among infinitely many
others, n2 + sin n and n2 + log n. (Can you explain why?)
Hopefully, this informal introduction has made you comfortable with the idea
behind the three asymptotic notations. So now come the formal definitions.
