DEFINITION    A function t (n) is said to be in O(g(n)), denoted t (n)  O(g(n)),
if t (n) is bounded above by some constant multiple of g(n) for all large n, i.e., if
there exist some positive constant c and some nonnegative integer n0 such that
                          t (n)  cg(n)  for all n  n0.
The definition is illustrated in Figure 2.1 where, for the sake of visual clarity, n is
extended to be a real number.
As an example, let us formally prove one of the assertions made in the
introduction: 100n + 5  O(n2). Indeed,
              100n + 5  100n + n (for all n  5) = 101n  101n2.
Thus, as values of the constants c and n0 required by the definition, we can take
101 and 5, respectively.
Note that the definition gives us a lot of freedom in choosing specific values
for constants c and n0. For example, we could also reason that
              100n + 5  100n + 5n (for all n  1) = 105n
to complete the proof with c = 105 and n0 = 1.

    DEFINITION   A function t (n) is said to be in         (g(n)), denoted t (n)   (g(n)), if
    t (n) is bounded below by some positive constant multiple of g(n) for all large n,
    i.e., if there exist some positive constant c and some nonnegative integer n0 such
    that

          Here is an example of the formal proof that n3           (n2):

    i.e., we can select c = 1 and n0 = 0.

DEFINITION        A function t (n) is said to be in                         (g(n)), denoted t (n)            (g(n)),
if t (n) is bounded both above and below by some positive constant multiples of
g(n) for all large n, i.e., if there exist some positive constants c1 and c2 and some
nonnegative integer n0 such that
                           c2g(n)  t (n)  c1g(n)                      for all n  n0.
The definition is illustrated in Figure 2.3.
For example, let us prove                    that     1  n(n   -  1)        (n2). First, we prove            the  right
inequality (the upper bound):                         2
                       1  n(n  -   1)    =   1 n2  -     1  n      1 n2     for all n  0.
                       2                     2           2        2
Second, we prove the left inequality (the lower bound):
            1  n(n  -  1)  =   1 n2   -  1   n        1 n2  -   1  n  1  n  (for  all  n       2)  =  1 n2.
            2                  2         2            2         2     2                               4
Hence,  we   can  select   c2  =   1  ,  c1  =  1  ,  and   n0    =   2.
