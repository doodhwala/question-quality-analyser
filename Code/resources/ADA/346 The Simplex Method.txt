We have already encountered linear programming (see Section 6.6)--the general
           problem of optimizing a linear function of several variables subject to a set of
           linear constraints:
           maximize (or minimize)        c1x1 + . . . + cnxn
                             subject to  ai1x1 + . . . + ainxn  (or  or =) bi  for i = 1, . . . , m
                                         x1  0, . . . , xn  0.                 (10.1)
           We mentioned there that many important practical problems can be modeled as
           instances of linear programming. Two researchers, L. V. Kantorovich of the former
           Soviet Union and the Dutch-American T. C. Koopmans, were even awarded the
           Nobel Prize in 1975 for their contributions to linear programming theory and
           its applications to economics. Apparently because there is no Nobel Prize in
           mathematics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences failed to honor the U.S.
           mathematician G. B. Dantzig, who is universally recognized as the father of linear
    programming in its modern form and the inventor of the simplex method, the
    classic algorithm for solving such problems.1
