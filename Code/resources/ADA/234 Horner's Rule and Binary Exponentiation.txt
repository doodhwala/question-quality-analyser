In this section, we discuss the problem of computing the value of a polynomial
                               p(x) = anxn + an-1xn-1 + . . . + a1x + a0                  (6.1)
          at a given point x and its important special case of computing xn. Polynomials
          constitute the most important class of functions because they possess a wealth of
          good properties on the one hand and can be used for approximating other types of
          functions on the other. The problem of manipulating polynomials efficiently has
          been important for several centuries; new discoveries were still being made the
          last 50 years. By far the most important of them was the fast Fourier transform
          (FFT). The practical importance of this remarkable algorithm, which is based on
          representing a polynomial by its values at specially chosen points, was such that
          some people consider it one of the most important algorithmic discoveries of all
          time. Because of its relative complexity, we do not discuss the FFT algorithm in this
          book. An interested reader will find a wealth of literature on the subject, including
          reasonably accessible treatments in such textbooks as [Kle06] and [Cor09].
