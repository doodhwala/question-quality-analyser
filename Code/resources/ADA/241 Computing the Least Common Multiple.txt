Recall that the least common multiple of two positive integers m and n, denoted
lcm(m, n), is defined as the smallest integer that is divisible by both m and n. For
example, lcm(24, 60) = 120, and lcm(11, 5) = 55. The least common multiple is
one of the most important notions in elementary arithmetic and algebra. Perhaps
you remember the following middle-school method for computing it: Given the
prime factorizations of m and n, compute the product of all the common prime
     factors of m and n, all the prime factors of m that are not in n, and all the prime
     factors of n that are not in m. For example,
                                   24 = 2 . 2 . 2 . 3,
                                   60 = 2 . 2 . 3 . 5,
                            lcm(24, 60) = (2 . 2 . 3) . 2 . 5 = 120.
     As a computational procedure, this algorithm has the same drawbacks as the
     middle-school algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor discussed
     in Section 1.1: it is inefficient and requires a list of consecutive primes.
     A much more efficient algorithm for computing the least common multiple
     can be devised by using problem reduction. After all, there is a very efficient
     algorithm (Euclid's algorithm) for finding the greatest common divisor, which is a
     product of all the common prime factors of m and n. Can we find a formula relating
     lcm(m, n) and gcd(m, n)? It is not difficult to see that the product of lcm(m, n) and
     gcd(m, n) includes every factor of m and n exactly once and hence is simply equal
     to the product of m and n. This observation leads to the formula
                                lcm(m, n) =           m.n     ,
                                                   gcd(m, n)
     where gcd(m, n) can be computed very efficiently by Euclid's algorithm.
