The term "exhaustive search" can also be applied to two very important algorithms
          that systematically process all vertices and edges of a graph. These two traversal
          algorithms are depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). These
          algorithms have proved to be very useful for many applications involving graphs in
          artificial intelligence and operations research. In addition, they are indispensable
          for efficient investigation of fundamental properties of graphs such as connectivity
          and cycle presence.
