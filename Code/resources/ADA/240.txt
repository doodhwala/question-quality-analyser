Problem Reduction
Here is my version of a well-known joke about mathematicians. Professor X, a
          noted mathematician, noticed that when his wife wanted to boil water for their
          tea, she took their kettle from their cupboard, filled it with water, and put it on
          the stove. Once, when his wife was away (if you have to know, she was signing
          her best-seller in a local bookstore), the professor had to boil water by himself.
          He saw that the kettle was sitting on the kitchen counter. What did Professor X
          do? He put the kettle in the cupboard first and then proceeded to follow his wife's
          routine.

    The way Professor X approached his task is an example of an important
problem-solving strategy called problem reduction. If you need to solve a problem,
reduce it to another problem that you know how to solve (Figure 6.15).
    The joke about the professor notwithstanding, the idea of problem reduction
plays a central role in theoretical computer science, where it is used to classify
problems according to their complexity. We will touch on this classification in
Chapter 11. But the strategy can be used for actual problem solving, too. The
practical difficulty in applying it lies, of course, in finding a problem to which the
problem at hand should be reduced. Moreover, if we want our efforts to be of
practical value, we need our reduction-based algorithm to be more efficient than
solving the original problem directly.
    Note that we have already encountered this technique earlier in the book.
In Section 6.5, for example, we mentioned the so-called synthetic division done
by applying Horner's rule for polynomial evaluation. In Section 5.5, we used the
following fact from analytical geometry: if p1(x1, y1), p2(x2, y2), and p3(x3, y3) are
three arbitrary points in the plane, then the determinant
                  x1     y1      1
                  x2     y2      1  = x1y2 + x3y1 + x2y3 - x3y2 - x1y3 - x2y1
                  x3     y3      1
is  positive  if  and  only  if  the  point  p3  is  to  the  left  of  the  directed  line  -p--p-  through
                                                                                             1   2
points p1 and p2.        In other words, we reduced a geometric question about the
relative locations of three points to a question about the sign of a determinant.
In fact, the entire idea of analytical geometry is based on reducing geometric
problems to algebraic ones. And the vast majority of geometric algorithms take
advantage of this historic insight by Rene´ Descartes (1596­1650). In this section,
we give a few more examples of algorithms based on the strategy of problem
reduction.
