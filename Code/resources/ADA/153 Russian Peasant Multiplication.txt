Now we consider a nonorthodox algorithm for multiplying two positive integers
called multiplication a` la russe or the Russian peasant method. Let n and m
be positive integers whose product we want to compute, and let us measure the
instance size by the value of n. Now, if n is even, an instance of half the size has
to deal with n/2, and we have an obvious formula relating the solution to the
problem's larger instance to the solution to the smaller one:
                                  n . m = n . 2m.
                                             2
If n is odd, we need only a slight adjustment of this formula:
                                n . m = n - 1 . 2m + m.
                                  2
Using these formulas and the trivial case of 1 . m = m to stop, we can compute
product n . m either recursively or iteratively. An example of computing 50 . 65
with this algorithm is given in Figure 4.11. Note that all the extra addends shown
in parentheses in Figure 4.11a are in the rows that have odd values in the first
column. Therefore, we can find the product by simply adding all the elements in
the m column that have an odd number in the n column (Figure 4.11b).
Also note that the algorithm involves just the simple operations of halving,
doubling, and adding--a feature that might be attractive, for example, to those

     who do not want to memorize the table of multiplications. It is this feature of the
     algorithm that most probably made it attractive to Russian peasants who, accord-
     ing to Western visitors, used it widely in the nineteenth century and for whom the
     method is named. (In fact, the method was known to Egyptian mathematicians as
     early as 1650 b.c. [Cha98, p. 16].) It also leads to very fast hardware implementa-
     tion since doubling and halving of binary numbers can be performed using shifts,
     which are among the most basic operations at the machine level.
