In this section, we look at two well-known algorithms: Warshall's algorithm for
          computing the transitive closure of a directed graph and Floyd's algorithm for the
          all-pairs shortest-paths problem. These algorithms are based on essentially the
          same idea: exploit a relationship between a problem and its simpler rather than
          smaller version. Warshall and Floyd published their algorithms without mention-
          ing dynamic programming. Nevertheless, the algorithms certainly have a dynamic
          programming flavor and have come to be considered applications of this tech-
          nique.
