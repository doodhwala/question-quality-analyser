You may recall from the introduction to this chapter that decrease-by-a-constant-
          factor is the second major variety of decrease-and-conquer. As an example of an
          algorithm based on this technique, we mentioned there exponentiation by squar-
          ing defined by formula (4.2). In this section, you will find a few other examples of
          such algorithms.. The most important and well-known of them is binary search.
          Decrease-by-a-constant-factor algorithms usually run in logarithmic time, and, be-
          ing very efficient, do not happen often; a reduction by a factor other than two is
          especially rare.
