The method of false position (also known by its name in Latin, regula falsi) is to
     interpolation search as the bisection method is to binary search. Like the bisection
     method, it has, on each iteration, some interval [an, bn] bracketing a root of a
     continuous function f (x) that has opposite-sign values at an and bn. Unlike the
     bisection method, however, it computes the next root approximation not as the
     middle of [an, bn] but as the x-intercept of the straight line through the points
     (an, f (an)) and (bn, f (bn)) (Figure 12.20).
     You are asked in the exercises to show that the formula for this x-intercept
     can be written as
                                     xn  =   anf   (bn)  -  bnf (an) .             (12.10)
                                                f  (bn)  -  f (an)
     EXAMPLE 2  Figure 12.21 contains the results of the first eight iterations of this
     method for solving equation (12.9).
     Although for this example the method of false position does not perform
     as well as the bisection method, for many instances it yields a faster converging
     sequence.
