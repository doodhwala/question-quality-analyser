Combinatorial Problems
From a more abstract perspective, the traveling salesman problem and the graph-
coloring problem are examples of combinatorial problems. These are problems
that ask, explicitly or implicitly, to find a combinatorial object--such as a permu-
tation, a combination, or a subset--that satisfies certain constraints. A desired
combinatorial object may also be required to have some additional property such
as a maximum value or a minimum cost.
    Generally speaking, combinatorial problems are the most difficult problems in
    computing, from both a theoretical and practical standpoint. Their difficulty stems
    from the following facts. First, the number of combinatorial objects typically grows
    extremely fast with a problem's size, reaching unimaginable magnitudes even
    for moderate-sized instances. Second, there are no known algorithms for solving
    most such problems exactly in an acceptable amount of time. Moreover, most
    computer scientists believe that such algorithms do not exist. This conjecture has
    been neither proved nor disproved, and it remains the most important unresolved
    issue in theoretical computer science. We discuss this topic in more detail in
    Section 11.3.
    Some combinatorial problems can be solved by efficient algorithms, but they
    should be considered fortunate exceptions to the rule. The shortest-path problem
    mentioned earlier is among such exceptions.
