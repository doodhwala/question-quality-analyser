In Section 3.3, we discussed the brute-force approach to solving two classic prob-
          lems of computational geometry: the closest-pair problem and the convex-hull
          problem. We saw that the two-dimensional versions of these problems can be
          solved by brute-force algorithms in     (n2) and O(n3) time, respectively. In this sec-
          tion, we discuss more sophisticated and asymptotically more efficient algorithms
          for these problems, which are based on the divide-and-conquer technique.
